# AllenBot

Our society runs everything on discord, so it'll make sense to have a discord bot, hence here it is! Bot for the one and only UoNM Computer Science Society 

Things planned for AllenBot:

- [ ] Brownie Point Tracking for members of the society that joins our planned events.
- [ ] Meeting Attendance (for committee members); Allen will be able to track users in a voice channel during a meeting and take their attendance
- [ ] Meeting Plans (for committee members); Allen will use discord events so members can look ahead on the coming events in our society!
- [ ] UoN Event Planning and Management; Allen will help committee members manage events that happen on discord through various features (TBD!)
